2025-09-13 12:51:17.333 +07:00 [WRN] The 'TopicStatus' property 'Status' on entity type 'TopicVersion' is configured with a database-generated default, but has no configured sentinel value. The database-generated default will always be used for inserts when the property has the value '0', since this is the CLR default for the 'TopicStatus' type. Consider using a nullable type, using a nullable backing field, or setting the sentinel value for the property to ensure the database default is used when, and only when, appropriate. See https://aka.ms/efcore-docs-default-values for more information.

2025-09-13 15:03:45.582 +07:00 [WRN] The 'TopicStatus' property 'Status' on entity type 'TopicVersion' is configured with a database-generated default, but has no configured sentinel value. The database-generated default will always be used for inserts when the property has the value '0', since this is the CLR default for the 'TopicStatus' type. Consider using a nullable type, using a nullable backing field, or setting the sentinel value for the property to ensure the database default is used when, and only when, appropriate. See https://aka.ms/efcore-docs-default-values for more information.

The database-generated default will always be used for inserts when the property has the value '0', since this is the CLR default for the 'ProficiencyLevels' type. Consider using a nullable type, using a nullable backing field, or setting the sentinel value for the property to ensure the database default is used when, and only when, appropriate. See https://aka.ms/efcore-docs-default-values for more information.

2025-09-13 16:26:39.360 +07:00 [WRN] The 'NotificationTypes' property 'Type' on entity type 'SystemNotification' is configured with a database-generated default, but has no configured sentinel value. The database-generated default will always be used for inserts when the property has the value '0', since this is the CLR default for the 'NotificationTypes' type.

Consider using a nullable type, using a nullable backing field, or setting the sentinel value for the property to ensure the database default is used when, and only when, appropriate. See https://aka.ms/efcore-docs-default-values for more information.
