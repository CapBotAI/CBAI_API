2025-08-06 03:06:23.609 +07:00 [WRN] The 'NotificationTypes' property 'Type' on entity type 'SystemNotification' is configured with a database-generated default, but has no configured sentinel value. The database-generated default will always be used for inserts when the property has the value '0', since this is the CLR default for the 'NotificationTypes' type.
